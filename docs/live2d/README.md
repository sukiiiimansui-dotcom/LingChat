# Live2D Documentation

LingChat supports Cubism 3, 4, and 5 models as an optional character visual layer. Static PNG/WebP rendering remains available and is used as the fallback when Live2D cannot load.

## Important Boundaries

- A Live2D variant is a visual rig belonging to one LingChat character. It does not create a new selectable character.
- `lingchat-live2d.json` is read during import only. The imported character's `settings.yml.live2d` is the runtime source of truth.
- LingChat keeps the existing static renderer, dialogue bubbles, touch layers, audio path, and emotion protocol. Live2D is an optional visual layer, not a replacement for those systems.
- Model files and Cubism Core have licenses separate from LingChat. Do not add third-party character assets to the repository without explicit redistribution rights.
